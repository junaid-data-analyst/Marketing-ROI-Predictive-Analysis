# Marketing ROI & Predictive Revenue Model
## 📊 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full data pipeline—from mathematical modeling to database engineering and executive visualization. The goal was to analyze the relationship between marketing spend and revenue to provide a **90%** confidence forecast for future budget allocation.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Excel:** Linear Regression, Correlation Analysis ($R^2 = 0.995$), and Residual Checks.
* **SQL (PostgreSQL):** Data Schema design, ROAS calculations, and data integrity constraints.
* **Power BI:** DAX Measures, Time-series Forecasting, and Gauge KPI visuals.

## 📈 Key Findings
* **Efficiency:** Every 1 SAR spent on marketing yields **5.26 SAR** in revenue.
* **Reliability:** The model explains **99.5%** of revenue variance, making it highly reliable for planning.
* **Baseline:** Organic revenue (intercept) is approximately **33,212 SAR** per month.

## 📁 Repository Structure
* `/data`: The raw and processed Excel datasets.
* `/sql`: Scripts for database creation and business logic.
* `/dashboard`: The Power BI (.pbix) file and screenshots.
